# Implementation Status

All critical features are implemented and production-ready across all three frameworks.

## ✅ DeepEval - Complete
- Basic metrics (relevancy, correctness, helpfulness)
- RAG evaluation (faithfulness, hallucination detection)
- Conversational metrics (multi-turn, role adherence)
- **Critical alignment metrics** (toxicity, bias, fairness)
- Code generation monitoring (security, quality)
- Comprehensive production demo

## ✅ RAGAs - Complete
- Core RAG metrics (faithfulness, relevancy, precision, recall)
- Advanced metrics (custom criteria, rubrics)
- Agent evaluation (goal accuracy, tool calls)
- **Critical alignment metrics** (toxicity, bias, fairness)
- Code generation monitoring
- Production evaluation patterns

## ✅ DeepChecks - Complete
- Data integrity validation
- Drift detection
- Model evaluation
- LLM system data validation
- Production monitoring dashboard
- Automated workflows
- CI/CD integration

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Low Priority
- Advanced enterprise integration examples
- Real-time streaming validation
- Predictive analytics
- Custom monitoring dashboards

See individual demo directories for detailed documentation.
